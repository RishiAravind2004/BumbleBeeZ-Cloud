# ðŸ“„ Dynamic Content Guide for BumbleBeeZ

This application dynamically loads **Credits** and **Update Logs** from external JSON files.  
Instead of releasing frequent app updates for small content changes, you can simply update these JSON files to reflect changes in real-time.

## ðŸŽ– Credits

Credits should follow the format below:

```json
{
  "Name of the member": "Role of the member"
}
```

Example:
```json

}
```
